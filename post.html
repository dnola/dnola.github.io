<p>In this blog post I intend to demonstrate a simple model of global
warming derived from the Stephan-Bolzmann law, and use it to build an
interactive model of global warming. The end goal of the model is to
look at one of the most direct results of an increase in global
tempurature: human death due to natural heat. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Global Warming?</span> <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Why death to natural heat?</span><br>
</p>
<br>
<p>Global warming is an oft-discussed topic that has become a
hot-button issue in many political discussions. The politization of
global warming has turned it into a highly controversial issue - but an
issue that is only really controversial in the media, and amongst
laypeople. In the scientific community, there exists a broad scientific
consensus that human inflicted climate change is not only possible, but
highly likely if current trends persist. In fact, no scientific body of
international standing disagrees with this view (<a
href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006EO360008/abstract">Source</a>).
All too often in the media, we discuss various sensor measurements and
debate various mechanisms that have affected tempurature through
history - but interpretation of the various measurements and theories
we hear have nothing to do with this consensus. These theories and
measurements are set up as a straw man that make global warming appear
much more controversial than it actually is - I'm positive you have
heard of arguments about global heating and cooling cycles by now (Like
<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/global-cooling-is-here/10783">this</a>).
The problem with these sorts of arguments is that the scientific
foundation of global warming doesn't stem from a belief in any sort of
cycle, or any past trend of measurement, incidence of ice age, or
anything else. In fact, the broad scientific consensus really has its
foundation in a simple law of physics you can find in any college level
textbook - the Stephan-Bolzmann Law. Given this law, it is
mathematically demonstrable that an increase in CO2 concentrations in
the atmosphere will increase global tempurature. I intend to
demonstrate that math here (It isn't hard), and show the repurcussions
of that math given the current trends of CO2 production relative to CO2
absorption. Global warming thus isn't so much a question of whether the
earth is on average heating or cooling, but it is really more of an
issue of how much mankind can directly 'move the needle' independant of
any cycle or historical fluctuation - and change global tempuratures
from what they would be otherwise.</p>
<p>As for why I chose to fixate on death to natural heat, again I want
to stick to the things I can demonstrate on paper in a way any typical
college educated layperson should be able to understand. Natural heat
kills hundreds of people every year, sometimes even reaching the
thousands. It follows that more heat means more death to heat - a trend
which I can demonstrate using government death statistics on a
state-by-state level. There are any number of theories on the
disastrous consequences of changes in global tempurature - but it is
hard to prove undeniably that any of these disasters will happen. Death
to natural heat, on the other hand, already happens - it is a fact that
natural heat is deadly, so it is a much more concrete consequence that
I can form my model on top of.<br>

<p>The Stephan Boltzman Law allows us to describe the power radiated
from a body’s surface given its effective temperature.</p>
<p> Given that we know Earth’s albedo, the temperature and radius of
the sun, and the distance to the sun, we can estimate what the average
temperature of the Earth should be, and compare it to what the average
observed temperature of the earth actually is. </p>
<p>Comparing these measurements allows us to estimate the fraction of
the earths average temperature that is a result of its atmosphere -
which ends up being about 33 degrees C.</p>
<p>We can then go a step further, and measure which gasses in the
atmosphere are responsible for this absorption:</p>
<p><br>
http://web.archive.org/web/20060330013311/http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/spring04/atmo451b/pdf/RadiationBudget.pdf
</p>
<p><br>
Lets assume the most conservative estimates for Methane and Carbon.
</p>
<p>Assuming Carbon represents nine percent of this heat retention -
.09*33 = 2.97C from Carbon.
</p>
<p>That means carbon is responsible for about 3 degrees of temperature
of the earth according to its current quantity.
</p>
<p>Our carbon emissions have been rising about 2.9% worldwide yearly
since 2000. </p>
<p>http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/pbl-2013-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2013-report-1148.pdf
</p>
<p><br>
ln(2)/.029 = about 24 years to double our rate of carbon emissions.
Ignoring human production, natural carbon production and absorption
roughly balance out.
Our annual production rate right now (2013) - 29 gigatons Net amount of
human production absorbed by plants and ocean - 12 gigatons
Amount of CO2 in atmosphere: 750 gigatons.
</p>
<p>Even if CO2 production stays constant instead of increasing, in 70
years we could conceivably double the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
So what can we do to fix it?
</p>
<p>(VISUALIZATION 1: Show what comprises our CO2 and Methane output
here, turn it into sliders, allow user to change sliders and see how
that would impact our atmospheric composition 60, 120, and 200 years
out)
</p>
<p>Using our math from before, what does this say about how earths
temperature will change?
</p>
<p>(VISUALIZATION 2: See how same sliders would impact our temperature
up to 200 years out using line chart)
</p>
<p>A fun toy example: while environmental scientists have theorized
about various indirect impacts on human life as a result of these
temperature changes, a much more direct impact on human life is death
by heat itself - how would changing temperature as a result of global
warming possibly effect human life?
</p>
<p>Using NBER data, we can figure out the number of deaths by natural
heat per state, compare this to average state temperature, and use a
linear regression to estimate the change in rate of death to natural
heat per degree average temperature increase. Then we can plot the
increase in temperature over time, and calculate how many people will
die directly due to global warming under various scenarios.
</p>
<p>(VISUALIZATION 3: See how same sliders would affect rate of death,
and total death toll by year 2200) </p>
